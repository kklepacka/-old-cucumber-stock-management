    Scenario: Warehouse charges should not exceed a third of the products value
      When I check the current product's value is 5
      And I check the warehouse's reference
      And I check the warehouse's maintenance cost
      And I check the warehouse's renting cost
      Then the charges should not exceed a third of the products value
